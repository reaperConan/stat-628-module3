Be aware, however, if you go to see a movie that has been out for awhile they might shuffle you into one of their Star Class theaters without the option of regular seating. You wind up paying $3 extra for each ticket and there are no other seating options. Seating in the Star Class theater is great if you are on a date but super awkward if you are with a group as the seats are arranged in twos.
